These libraries *are not* packaged with the Toggl Desktop app.

To install Qt, please follow these links:

http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

After building and installing Qt, you'll need
to add the libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order for the
Toggl Desktop app to run. You can run add it each time you run the
Toggl Desktop app like this:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./TogglDesktop

(Assuming the Qt libraries at /home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib)

Or you can append the libraries permanently like this:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(Then just type ./TogglDesktop to run the Toggl Desktop app).

Please note that the Qt libraries may or may not be
available on your distro as a prebuilt package.
Installing the libraries from source is possible on any Linux platform.

the feedback to resolve the issue faster.
